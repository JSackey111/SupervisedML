Introduction:
As part of the internship program with The Sparks Foundation, a beginner task was given to make a prediction using Supervised ML. The dataset used was obtained from http://bit.ly/w-data. 
The dataset contains two variables, which makes it very easy to use the linear regression model. The linear regression model was chosen because it allows for estimating the relationship between the two variables, in this case, hours and Scores. Therefore it allows estimating how a dependent variable changes as independent variables changes.

Objectives
The objective of the study was to predict the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours.
Methodology/Workflow

Import necessary libraries such as 
•	pandas to store and manipulate the dataset
•	matplotlib for visualization
•	sklearn for machine learning models 

Loading datasets from the URL  link 
Perform Data pre-processing 
Perform exploratory data Analysis (EDA)
Perform Machine-learning models
 

Conclusion

The prediction shows that the student who studied for 9.25 hours/day will get a score of 92.9%.
